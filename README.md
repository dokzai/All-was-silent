# All-was-silent
This game/interactive function was inspired by the comic: ‘This croc will die in 100 days’ by twitter user @yuukikikuchi. I personally was really impacted by the portrayal of death in the comic. For most of us, the concept of mortality and death is not discussed that often. Even when it is discussed it is talked about almost in a taboo fashion. In a way, I thought it was a little strange that something that is common and happens to everyone eventually isn’t talked about a lot and in a more open manner.

In a way this restraint on talking about death made me want to explore someone with lots of regrets left and mismanaged use of time, and numbed her pain through procrastination and trash television. I knew I wanted to explore the concept and view it from the lens of a normal person, who would die in unpredictable and unplanned accidents that happen across the world daily. I thought that the best way to talk about it was to create interactive art (literature/drawings).

So I ask you the question, what would you do if you had one day left?

# What it does
This game explores the final day of Asha’s life. Asha represents the hardworking normal person. She’s the adult daughter of a single mother, who through blood sweat and tears worked to achieve a small degree of financial stability from living under poverty. To do this, Asha gave up many life experiences and little mundane things to achieve it. Asha never took risks or did anything that was exciting, missing through what everyone considered growing up to become an adult quickly.
